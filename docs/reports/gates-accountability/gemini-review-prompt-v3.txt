 **Escape hatch:** For [HOTFIX] tagged issues, user can explicitly waive.

+**Prompt formatting (MANDATORY):**
+1. Include FULL LLD content in the prompt file (not just a reference)
+2. Start with: "REVIEW THE FOLLOWING LLD ONLY. DO NOT SEARCH FOR OTHER FILES."
+3. End with: "END OF LLD. Respond with JSON only."
+4. Read back prompt file before submission to verify content is correct
+
+**Post-review validation:**
+1. Gemini's response must reference the correct issue number
+2. Gemini's response must mention sections from YOUR submitted LLD
+3. If Gemini reviewed wrong content: **THIS IS CLAUDE'S FAULT** - fix prompt, resubmit
+
+**ACCOUNTABILITY:** If Gemini reviews the wrong document, Claude failed to provide clear input. Fix the prompt and resubmit. NEVER blame Gemini for Claude's prompt failures.
