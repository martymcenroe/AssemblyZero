Issue: Claude blamed Gemini for reviewing wrong LLD; fix adds accountability

CHANGES MADE (git diff):
+**Prompt formatting (MANDATORY):**
+1. Include FULL LLD content in the prompt file (not just a reference)
+2. Start with: "REVIEW THE FOLLOWING LLD ONLY. DO NOT SEARCH FOR OTHER FILES."
+3. End with: "END OF LLD. Respond with JSON only."
+4. Read back prompt file before submission to verify content is correct
+
+**Post-review validation:**
+1. Gemini's response must reference the correct issue number
+2. Gemini's response must mention sections from YOUR submitted LLD
+3. If Gemini reviewed wrong content: **THIS IS CLAUDE'S FAULT** - fix prompt, resubmit
+
+**ACCOUNTABILITY:** If Gemini reviews the wrong document, Claude failed to provide clear input. Fix the prompt and resubmit. NEVER blame Gemini for Claude's prompt failures.

Same changes added to IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW GATE.

DESIGN DECISIONS:
1. Place in COMPACTION-SAFE section (survives context limits)
2. Use "CLAUDE'S FAULT" language (unambiguous blame)
3. Require FULL content (prevents wrong file lookups)

END OF IMPLEMENTATION. Respond with JSON only:
{"verdict": "[APPROVE]" or "[BLOCK]", "commit_reviewed": "30f8482", "summary": "one sentence", "concerns": [], "blocking_issues": []}
