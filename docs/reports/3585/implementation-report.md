# Implementation Report: the testing graph and three of its nodes under standard 0034 (#3585 step 5, batch C)

The rule is ADR 0236 and standard 0034. This branch, `3585-testing-graph`, is batch C of the testing workflow's sweep: `assemblyzero/workflows/testing/graph.py` with its routers, and the nodes `load_lld.py`, `augment_tests.py` and `e2e_validation.py`. One commit per module, each ledger 0908 row fixed and tested, or kept and pinned. The other batches of the testing workflow are on their own branches. When the branches meet, each keeps its own sections of this file and its sibling.

## Modules

### graph.py (15 ledger rows: 14 fixed, 1 fixed earlier by #3725 and pinned)

- **Every stop a router decides reaches HALT (232, 245, 318, 355, 438, 447, 451, 471, 478, 488, 513).** The iteration caps, the cost budget, the spent coverage attempts, a BLOCKED plan under the strict policy or out of revisions, an exhausted scaffold that named no reason, and a route a node did not name each ended the run at END, which writes no halt bundle and alerts no one; the stage then read the empty `error_message` as a pass. Each condition now lives in one `_stop_after_*` function. The router consults it and routes to HALT. The node in front of the router is wrapped by `_records_its_stop`, which applies the same function to the node's result and records the reason as `error_message` at ERROR on stderr, so HALT's alert carries it.
- **auto_mode no longer hides a failed gate (217, 227).** `--review none`, the default, sets `auto_mode`, under which an N1 error was ignored and a BLOCKED test plan was walked past to N2. Any error now halts; a BLOCKED plan is revised under auto as under the default policy and halts when the revisions are spent.
- **A failed checkpoint stops the run (128).** The wrapper printed the error and carried on. It now writes an ERROR line naming the checkpoint, node, worktree and issue, and raises `CheckpointFailed` from the cause. Both callers of the graph alert on it, so it does not alert a second time.
- **The adversarial review's halt is pinned (557).** #3725 already routes N7.5's recorded reason to HALT.
- **Structure.** The edge maps of N1, N2.5, N3, N5 and N6 lose their `end` entries, which nothing can take now, and `testing/atlas.py` follows. The gate registry names the twelve new halt sites; three new impl rows (`impl.coverage_augment_spent`, `impl.budget.cost`, `impl.route_unrecognised`) cite the operator's ruling of 2026-10-06, and the impl ratchet in `tests/fixtures/gate_registry_baseline.json` goes from 44 to 47.

## Compliance

Every failure path above meets the four properties of standard 0034: it writes an ERROR line on stderr naming what failed and its subject, it stops what depends on it (a HALT route, or a raise the entry point owns), and it alerts the operator, through HALT or through the caller's handler.
