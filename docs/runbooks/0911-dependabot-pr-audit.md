# 0911 - Dependabot PR Audit

**Category:** Runbook / Security Maintenance
**Version:** 2.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-19

---

## Purpose

Safely review, approve, and merge Dependabot PRs with regression verification. Dependency updates land on main only after the full test suite passes against the bumped versions in an isolated worktree. On test failure, PRs are commented and left for human review; multi-package PRs are split via `@dependabot recreate`.

**Key principle (unchanged from v1.0):** Trust exit codes, not LLM interpretation of test output.

**New in v2.0:**
- Test-then-merge order (v1.0 merged-then-tested — wrong order on branch-protected repos)
- Author gate: tool refuses any PR not authored by `dependabot[bot]`
- `No-Issue:` body injection so pr-sentinel's exemption path passes (v1.0 predated this)
- Explicit approval step attributing to the invoking user (Code Review profile stat accrues to the user, not to Cerberus-AZ)
- Multi-package split via `@dependabot recreate` on failure
- Poetry venv eviction integrated (#944 / Fix 5 pattern) so worktrees remove cleanly on Windows
- Mechanical implementation: `tools/dependabot_review.py`

---

## Implementation

The manual procedure in v1.0 has been replaced by a deterministic Python tool at `tools/dependabot_review.py` invokable via the `/dependabot` skill.

```bash
cd /c/Users/mcwiz/Projects/AssemblyZero
poetry run python tools/dependabot_review.py [--dry-run]
```

Or via the skill: `/dependabot`.

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Check |
|---|---|
| Clean working directory on main | `git status` |
| Poetry installed | `poetry --version` |
| GitHub CLI authenticated | `gh auth status` |
| Must NOT run from inside a worktree | `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` matches main repo path |

---

## Hard gates (enforced by the tool)

### Author gate

For each PR returned by `gh pr list --author app/dependabot`, the tool re-verifies `pr.author.login == "dependabot[bot]"` before any action. Any mismatch is a hard refusal — no approval, no merge, status recorded as `errored`.

This prevents the tool from ever operating on a PR it wasn't designed to handle. Even if someone crafts an unrelated PR and passes it through this tool, it won't be approved or merged.

### Exit-code gate

`poetry run pytest -q --tb=short` must exit 0. Any non-zero exit means:
- No approval, no merge
- A comment is posted on the PR noting the exit code and the forensics worktree path
- The PR is recorded as `deferred`
- The worktree is NOT cleaned up — it's left in place so the user can investigate
- If the PR updates multiple packages, `@dependabot recreate` is posted to split it into per-package PRs

No human judgment is applied to the exit code. No LLM is consulted about whether "the failures look related." Trust the exit code.

---

## End-to-end flow (per PR)

```
1. Create audit worktree from current main at ../AssemblyZero-dependabot-<N>
2. `gh pr checkout <N>` into the worktree — brings the dependabot bump in
3. Evict cached poetry venv (Fix 5 / #944) so locks release
4. `poetry install` — fresh install of updated dependencies
5. `poetry run pytest -q --tb=short` — capture exit code

   --- exit != 0 ---
6a. Comment on PR with exit code + worktree path (forensics)
6b. If multi-package, comment `@dependabot recreate`
6c. Leave worktree in place; move to next PR

   --- exit == 0 ---
6a. `gh pr edit <N> --body "<body>\n\nNo-Issue: automated dependency update (...)"`
     — satisfies pr-sentinel Worker's No-Issue exemption
6b. Wait 5s for pr-sentinel to re-evaluate
6c. `gh pr review <N> --approve --body "..."` — PullRequestReview event
     attributed to the invoking user (Code Review profile stat accrues to that user)
6d. Poll `mergeable_state` until `clean` (up to 5 min)
6e. `gh pr merge <N> --squash`
6f. Evict worktree's poetry venv; `git worktree remove`; `git branch -D` the
     audit branch
```

## Why the invoking user approves (not Cerberus-AZ)

Cerberus-AZ auto-approves Marty-authored PRs after pr-sentinel passes. Its approval events are attributed to the Cerberus-AZ GitHub App, not to the user. GitHub's Code Review profile stat counts reviews authored by the user.

For dependabot PRs specifically — where the user did NOT author the code — the correct attribution is the user. The tool uses the invoking user's `gh` credentials to create the approval event. This is a bounded, author-gated, exit-code-gated scope; the same credentials do NOT approve anything else.

Constraints embedded in the tool:
- Author must be `dependabot[bot]` (hard gate)
- Tests must exit 0 (hard gate)
- Approval body explicitly names the tool and its gates

Outside this specific tool, agent-initiated approvals remain disallowed.

---

## On multi-package PRs

Dependabot PR bodies include one `` Updates `<package>` `` block per bumped package. The tool counts these via regex. If a multi-package PR fails tests:

1. The failure comment is posted
2. `@dependabot recreate` is posted as a second comment — dependabot listens for this and splits the grouped update into per-package PRs
3. The next `/dependabot` run processes the smaller PRs, and typically only one of the per-package splits actually fails

This is bisect-by-dependabot, not bisect-by-us. Dependabot does the splitting; our tool processes whatever dependabot produces.

---

## Forensics on failure

When the tool leaves a worktree in place, it's at `C:/Users/mcwiz/Projects/AssemblyZero-dependabot-<N>`. You can:

```bash
cd C:/Users/mcwiz/Projects/AssemblyZero-dependabot-<N>
poetry run pytest --tb=long <path_to_failing_test> -x
```

When done investigating:

```bash
cd /c/Users/mcwiz/Projects/AssemblyZero
poetry env remove --all
git worktree remove ../AssemblyZero-dependabot-<N>
git branch -D dependabot-audit-<N>
```

The cleanup skill will also catch this as an orphan directory per Fix 5's logic.

---

## Summary output

At end of run, the tool prints:

```
=== Summary ===
  Merged:   [756, 741]
  Deferred: [479]
  Errored:  []
```

- **Merged:** PR passed both gates and is on main.
- **Deferred:** PR failed a gate (test failure or poetry install failure). Worktree retained, comment posted, possibly `@dependabot recreate` posted.
- **Errored:** Infrastructure failure (couldn't create worktree, couldn't checkout PR, couldn't approve, etc.). Worktree is cleaned up; the PR needs manual attention.

---

## Integration

Run this audit:

- On demand via `/dependabot`
- Before shipping a batch of features (so dependencies stay current)
- Weekly as maintenance if the queue has been neglected
- Can be wired to the `schedule` skill for passive processing — not in scope for v2.0

## History

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-02-15 | v1.0: Initial runbook — manual procedure, merge-first / test-after, no pr-sentinel integration |
| 2026-04-19 | v2.0 (#949): Rewritten for current branch protection + pr-sentinel. Test-then-merge order. Author gate, exit-code gate, `No-Issue:` body injection, approval attributed to invoking user (Code Review stat), multi-package split via `@dependabot recreate`, poetry venv eviction. Mechanical implementation at `tools/dependabot_review.py` and `/dependabot` skill. |
