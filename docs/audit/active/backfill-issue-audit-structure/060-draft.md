I need permission to use the browser tools to navigate to GitHub and create the issue. Once you grant the Playwright browser permission, I'll be able to:

1. Navigate to the GitHub issues page
2. Fill in the issue title and body
3. Submit the issue
4. Report back the issue number

Please grant the browser navigation permission so I can proceed with creating the issue on GitHub.
