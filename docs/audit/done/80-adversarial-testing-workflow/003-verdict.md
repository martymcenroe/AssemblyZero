# Issue Review: Adversarial Testing Workflow: Separation of Implementation from Verification

## Identity Confirmation
I am Gemini 3 Pro, acting as Senior Technical Product Manager & Governance Lead.

## Pre-Flight Gate
PASSED

## Review Summary
The issue presents a robust governance mechanism for LLM-generated code. However, it fails "Definition of Ready" due to critical Safety risks regarding automated execution of generated scripts and missing Cost analysis for the secondary model usage.

## Tier 1: BLOCKING Issues

### Security
- [ ] No blocking issues found.

### Safety
- [ ] **Permission Friction (Audit 0815):** The workflow describes the Orchestrator automatically running `verify-{feature}.sh` (generated by an LLM) *before* human review (Scenario 1, Step 3). This executes arbitrary shell code with the user's permissions. **Requirement:** Must introduce a "Dry Run" mode, a confirmation prompt before execution, or mandate Docker containerization in the Technical Approach.
- [ ] **Fail-Safe Strategy:** The workflow relies on the Implementation LLM to provide a runnable script. If the script hangs or consumes infinite resources, the Orchestrator may freeze. **Requirement:** Define timeout limits and resource constraints for the `subprocess` execution.

### Cost
- [ ] **Budget Estimate:** This feature doubles the inference cost per ticket (Implementation LLM + Testing LLM). No budget estimate or cost control strategy (e.g., "limit adversarial testing to complex tickets") is provided. **Requirement:** Add an estimated cost impact analysis or usage limits.

### Legal
- [ ] No blocking issues found.

## Tier 2: HIGH PRIORITY Issues

### Quality
- [ ] No high-priority issues found. Context is complete.

### Architecture
- [ ] **Offline Development:** The `Testing Notes` describe testing with "intentionally broken implementation" but do not mention how to develop the Orchestrator without making live API calls to Gemini. **Recommendation:** Add a requirement for "Mocked LLM Responses/Fixtures" to the Technical Approach to allow offline/cost-free development of the tool logic.

## Tier 3: SUGGESTIONS
- **Taxonomy:** Add `governance` and `safety` labels.
- **Model Selection:** Specify which Gemini model (Flash vs. Pro) is intended for the "Testing LLM" to balance cost vs. reasoning capability.

## Questions for Orchestrator
1. Does the existing "Gemini integration" cover data residency requirements for sending proprietary code to this model for analysis?

## Verdict
[ ] **APPROVED** - Ready to enter backlog
[x] **REVISE** - Fix Tier 1/2 issues first
[ ] **DISCUSS** - Needs Orchestrator decision
