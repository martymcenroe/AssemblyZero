# Test Timer Feature

Quick test brief to verify the timer works during workflow execution.

## User Story
As a developer watching the workflow,
I want to see elapsed time during API calls,
So that I know the workflow is still running and not stuck.

## Requirements
- Add a timestamp log message
- The message should be visible

## Technical Approach
- Use Python's print() function
- Output to console

## Acceptance Criteria
- Log message appears
- Contains a timestamp

## Out of Scope
- Log files (console only)
