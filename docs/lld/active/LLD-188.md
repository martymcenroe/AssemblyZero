# 188 - Feature: Implementation Workflow Should Enforce File Paths from LLD

<!-- Template Metadata
Last Updated: 2025-01-10
Updated By: Gemini Review #2 feedback
Update Reason: Added T080 to TDD Execution Plan (Section 10.0) and clarified allowed_paths static constraint
-->

## 1. Context & Goal
* **Issue:** #188
* **Objective:** Enforce LLD-specified file paths during implementation to prevent Claude from placing files in arbitrary locations
* **Status:** Approved (gemini-3-pro-preview, 2026-02-03)
* **Related Issues:** #177 (evidence of the problem)

### Open Questions

- [x] Should path validation be hard (reject/fail) or soft (warn but allow)? → Hard rejection per issue specification
- [x] How to handle legitimate cases where LLD paths need modification mid-implementation? → **RESOLVED: The agent must pause implementation, update Section 2.1 of the LLD file to include the new path, and then resume. The validator must re-read the LLD (or the agent must restart the workflow step) to recognize the change.**

## 2. Proposed Changes

*This section is the **source of truth** for implementation. Describe exactly what will be built.*

### 2.1 Files Changed

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `assemblyzero/workflows/implement_code.py` | Modify | Add LLD path extraction and injection into prompt |
| `assemblyzero/utils/lld_path_enforcer.py` | Add | New module for extracting and validating file paths from LLD |
| `assemblyzero/hooks/file_write_validator.py` | Add | Pre-write hook to reject non-LLD paths |
| `tests/unit/test_lld_path_enforcer.py` | Add | Unit tests for path enforcement |
| `tests/unit/test_file_write_validator.py` | Add | Unit tests for file write validation |

### 2.2 Dependencies

*No new packages required. Uses existing standard library modules.*

```toml
# pyproject.toml additions (if any)
# None - uses pathlib, re from stdlib
```

### 2.3 Data Structures

```python
# Pseudocode - NOT implementation
class LLDPathSpec(TypedDict):
    implementation_files: list[str]  # Paths for main implementation
    test_files: list[str]            # Paths for test files
    config_files: list[str]          # Paths for config/data files
    all_allowed_paths: set[str]      # Combined set for validation
    scaffolded_test_files: set[str]  # Test files that already exist on disk

class PathValidationResult(TypedDict):
    allowed: bool                    # Whether the path is permitted
    requested_path: str              # The path that was requested
    closest_match: str | None        # Suggested LLD path if rejected
    reason: str                      # Explanation for allow/reject
```

### 2.4 Function Signatures

```python
# assemblyzero/utils/lld_path_enforcer.py

def extract_paths_from_lld(lld_content: str) -> LLDPathSpec:
    """Extract all file paths specified in LLD Section 2.1."""
    ...

def parse_files_changed_table(markdown_table: str) -> list[tuple[str, str, str]]:
    """Parse the Files Changed markdown table into (path, change_type, description) tuples."""
    ...

def detect_scaffolded_test_files(test_files: list[str], base_path: Path) -> set[str]:
    """Check which test files already exist on disk (scaffolded)."""
    ...

def build_implementation_prompt_section(path_spec: LLDPathSpec) -> str:
    """Generate the file path enforcement section for the implementation prompt.
    
    Marks scaffolded test files with 'DO NOT MODIFY' warning.
    """
    ...


# assemblyzero/hooks/file_write_validator.py

def validate_file_write(
    requested_path: str,
    allowed_paths: set[str],
    strict: bool = True
) -> PathValidationResult:
    """Validate a file write request against LLD-specified paths."""
    ...

def find_closest_lld_path(requested_path: str, allowed_paths: set[str]) -> str | None:
    """Find the most similar allowed path for helpful error messages."""
    ...

def register_path_enforcement_hook(allowed_paths: set[str]) -> None:
    """Register the file write validator as a pre-write hook."""
    ...
```

### 2.5 Logic Flow (Pseudocode)

```
IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW WITH PATH ENFORCEMENT:

1. Load LLD content for the issue
2. Extract file paths from Section 2.1 (Files Changed table)
   - Parse markdown table
   - Categorize by change type (Add/Modify)
   - Build allowed paths set
3. Detect scaffolded test files:
   FOR each path in test_files:
     IF file exists on disk:
       Add to scaffolded_test_files set
4. Generate path enforcement prompt section:
   """
   REQUIRED FILE PATHS (from LLD - do not deviate):
   - path/to/file.py  # Description
   - tests/test_xxx.py  # Tests - DO NOT MODIFY (already scaffolded)
   
   Any files written to other paths will be rejected.
   """
   
   FOR each path in all_allowed_paths:
     IF path in scaffolded_test_files:
       Append " - DO NOT MODIFY (already scaffolded)" to line
5. Inject prompt section into implementation prompt
6. Register file write validator hook with allowed paths
7. Execute implementation

FILE WRITE VALIDATION (on each file write):
1. Receive requested write path
2. Normalize path (resolve relative, remove ./)
3. Check if path in allowed_paths set
4. IF allowed:
   - Return success, permit write
5. ELSE:
   - Find closest matching LLD path
   - Return rejection with helpful message
   - Log rejected write attempt
   - Block the write operation
```

### 2.6 Technical Approach

* **Module:** `assemblyzero/utils/lld_path_enforcer.py`, `assemblyzero/hooks/file_write_validator.py`
* **Pattern:** Pre-write hook pattern with path whitelist
* **Key Decisions:** 
  - Hard rejection (not soft warning) to force compliance
  - Path normalization to handle relative path variations
  - Helpful error messages with closest LLD path suggestion
  - Scaffolded test file detection via filesystem check
  - **The `allowed_paths` set is static per implementation step** - if the LLD is updated mid-run, the agent must restart the `implement_code` step to reload the paths

### 2.7 Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Options Considered | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| Validation mode | Soft warning vs Hard rejection | Hard rejection | Issue explicitly requires rejection; warnings were proven ineffective in #177 |
| Path matching | Exact match vs Pattern/glob | Exact match with normalization | LLD specifies exact paths; glob adds complexity without benefit |
| Hook placement | Pre-write hook vs Post-write cleanup | Pre-write hook | Prevent bad writes rather than clean up after; saves iterations |
| Path extraction | Regex vs Markdown parser | Markdown table parser | More robust; handles edge cases in table formatting |
| Scaffolded detection | Hardcoded list vs Filesystem check | Filesystem check | Dynamic detection; no manual tracking needed |
| Path set mutability | Dynamic reload vs Static per step | Static per step | Simplicity; avoids race conditions; explicit restart for changes |

**Architectural Constraints:**
- Must integrate with existing `implement_code.py` workflow
- Must not break existing file write mechanisms for allowed paths
- Must preserve test file scaffolding protection (tests are pre-created, not modified)
- The `allowed_paths` set is immutable during a single implementation step execution

## 3. Requirements

*What must be true when this is done. These become acceptance criteria.*

1. Implementation prompt includes explicit file paths extracted from LLD Section 2.1
2. File write validator rejects any writes to paths not in LLD
3. Rejected writes include helpful error message with closest LLD path
4. Iteration count decreases for typical implementations (measurable via #177-style tracking)
5. Test files marked as "DO NOT MODIFY" in prompt when already scaffolded (detected via filesystem check)

## 4. Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| Hard rejection of non-LLD paths | Forces compliance, prevents orphaned files | May block legitimate edge cases | **Selected** |
| Soft warning with logging | Less disruptive, allows flexibility | Proven ineffective (#177 evidence) | Rejected |
| Post-write cleanup | Simpler implementation | Wastes iterations, doesn't prevent bad writes | Rejected |
| Pattern-based matching (globs) | More flexible | Adds complexity, unclear specification | Rejected |

**Rationale:** The issue explicitly cites wasted iterations and orphaned files from #177. Only hard rejection addresses the root cause. Soft warnings were implicitly tried (Claude was "told" to use certain paths) and failed across 10 iterations.

## 5. Data & Fixtures

### 5.1 Data Sources

## 7. Security & Safety Considerations

### 7.1 Security

| Concern | Mitigation | Status |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Path traversal in LLD | Normalize and validate all paths; reject `../` patterns | Addressed |
| LLD tampering | LLD files are under version control with PR review | Addressed |

### 7.2 Safety

| Concern | Mitigation | Status |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Blocking legitimate writes | Provide escape hatch via LLD amendment process | Addressed |
| Orphaned partial implementation | Hard rejection prevents partial file scatter | Addressed |
| Test file corruption | Test files marked as protected; writes blocked | Addressed |

**Fail Mode:** Fail Closed - If path validation fails to initialize, block all writes rather than allowing unvalidated writes.

**Recovery Strategy:** If implementation is blocked unexpectedly, update LLD Section 2.1 with required paths and restart.

## 8. Performance & Cost Considerations

### 8.1 Performance

| Metric | Budget | Approach |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Path validation latency | < 1ms per check | Set lookup O(1) |
| LLD parsing | < 100ms | Single pass regex + table parse |
| Scaffolded detection | < 50ms | Filesystem stat calls for test files only |
| Memory | < 1MB | Paths stored as string set |

**Bottlenecks:** None expected. Path set is typically < 20 entries.

### 8.2 Cost Analysis

| Resource | Unit Cost | Estimated Usage | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| LLM iterations saved | ~$0.10 per iteration | 2-5 iterations per impl | ~$0.50 saved per issue |

**Cost Controls:**
- N/A - This feature reduces costs by preventing wasted iterations

**Worst-Case Scenario:** No cost impact - pure local validation.

## 9. Legal & Compliance

| Concern | Applies? | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|------------|
| PII/Personal Data | No | No personal data processed |
| Third-Party Licenses | No | Uses only stdlib |
| Terms of Service | No | Internal tooling only |
| Data Retention | N/A | No data retained |
| Export Controls | No | No restricted algorithms |

**Data Classification:** Internal

**Compliance Checklist:**
- [x] No PII stored
- [x] All code original or properly licensed
- [x] No external service dependencies

## Original GitHub Issue #188
# Issue #188: Implementation workflow should enforce file paths from LLD

## Problem

The implementation workflow (TDD) allows Claude to place files in arbitrary locations, ignoring the paths specified in the LLD.

### Evidence from #177

The LLD specified:
```
assemblyzero/utils/lld_verification.py
```

But across 10 iterations, Claude wrote to:
- `assemblyzero/utils/lld_verification.py` (correct)
- `assemblyzero/core/lld_verification.py` (wrong)
- `tests/test_lld_verification.py` (blocked by protection)

This inconsistency caused:
1. Wasted iterations
2. Orphaned files in wrong locations
3. Coverage measurement issues (wrong module path)

## Root Cause

The implementation prompt doesn't enforce file paths from the LLD. It just says "implement the feature" without specifying exact output locations.

## Proposed Fix

In `implement_code.py`, the implementation prompt should include:

```
REQUIRED FILE PATHS (from LLD - do not deviate):
- assemblyzero/utils/lld_verification.py  # Main implementation
- tests/test_issue_177.py  # Tests (already scaffolded, DO NOT MODIFY)

Any files written to other paths will be rejected.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implementation prompt includes file paths from LLD
- [ ] File path validator rejects writes to non-LLD paths
- [ ] Iteration count decreases for typical implementations
