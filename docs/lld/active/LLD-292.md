# 1292 - Feature: Add pytest exit code routing to TDD workflow

<!-- Template Metadata
Last Updated: 2026-02-02
Updated By: Issue #292 creation
Update Reason: Revision 1 - Address Gemini Review #1 feedback (retry limit implementation, logging tests)
-->

## 1. Context & Goal
* **Issue:** #292
* **Objective:** Add specific pytest exit code handling for proper error routing in the TDD workflow, enabling differentiated responses to test failures vs. syntax errors vs. collection errors.
* **Status:** Approved (gemini-3-pro-preview, 2026-02-04)
* **Related Issues:** #87 (Parent - Implementation Workflow)

### Open Questions
*Questions that need clarification before or during implementation. Remove when resolved.*

- [x] Should exit codes be stored in TDD state for debugging? **Yes - per issue requirements**
- [x] Should there be a maximum retry count for N2 re-scaffold loops (exit codes 4,5)? **Yes - implemented via state history check in verify_red_phase with configurable limit (default 3)**
- [x] What constitutes "Human Review" - pause workflow, create issue, or notification? **Routing to the HUMAN_REVIEW node, which pauses the workflow and flags requires_human: True in the RouteDestination**

## 2. Proposed Changes

*This section is the **source of truth** for implementation. Describe exactly what will be built.*

### 2.1 Files Changed

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `assemblyzero/workflows/testing/exit_code_router.py` | Add | New module for pytest exit code routing logic |
| `assemblyzero/workflows/testing/tdd_state.py` | Add | New module for TDD state with exit_code field |
| `assemblyzero/workflows/testing/nodes/verify_phases.py` | Modify | Update verify_red_phase() and verify_green_phase() to use exit codes with retry limit enforcement |
| `tests/unit/test_exit_code_router.py` | Add | Unit tests for exit code router |
| `tests/unit/test_verify_phases_exit_codes.py` | Add | Integration tests for phase verification with exit codes |

### 2.1.1 Path Validation (Mechanical - Auto-Checked)

*Issue #277: Before human or Gemini review, paths are verified programmatically.*

Mechanical validation automatically checks:
- All "Modify" files must exist in repository
- All "Delete" files must exist in repository
- All "Add" files must have existing parent directories
- No placeholder prefixes (`src/`, `lib/`, `app/`) unless directory exists

**If validation fails, the LLD is BLOCKED before reaching review.**

### 2.2 Dependencies

*No new dependencies required.*

```toml
# pyproject.toml additions (if any)
# None - uses existing pytest and standard library
```

### 2.3 Data Structures

```python
# Pseudocode - NOT implementation
from enum import IntEnum
from typing import TypedDict, Literal

class PytestExitCode(IntEnum):
    """Pytest exit codes per pytest documentation."""
    TESTS_PASSED = 0
    TESTS_FAILED = 1
    INTERRUPTED = 2
    INTERNAL_ERROR = 3
    USAGE_ERROR = 4
    NO_TESTS_COLLECTED = 5

class RouteDestination(TypedDict):
    """Routing result for exit code handling."""
    next_node: str  # Node identifier (e.g., "N2", "N4", "HUMAN_REVIEW")
    reason: str  # Human-readable explanation
    requires_human: bool  # Whether human intervention is needed
    retry_allowed: bool  # Whether automatic retry is permitted

class TDDPhase(Literal["RED", "GREEN", "REFACTOR"]):
    """Current phase in TDD cycle."""
    pass

# Extension to existing TDDState
class TDDStateExtension(TypedDict):
    exit_code: int | None  # Last pytest exit code
    exit_code_history: list[int]  # History for debugging
    route_history: list[str]  # History of routing decisions

# Configuration for retry limits
class RetryConfig(TypedDict):
    max_scaffold_retries: int  # Default: 3
```

   - Return next_node: "N2" (re-scaffold)
   - Set retry_allowed: True
8. IF exit_code == 5 (NO_TESTS_COLLECTED):
   - Log: "No tests collected, re-scaffold required"
   - Return next_node: "N2" (re-scaffold)
   - Set retry_allowed: True
9. ELSE (unknown exit code):
   - Log: "Unknown exit code {exit_code}, requires human review"

   - Set requires_human: True

check_retry_limit_exceeded(exit_code_history, max_retries):
1. IF len(exit_code_history) < max_retries:

     - Log: "Scaffold retry limit exceeded after {max_scaffold_retries} attempts"
     - Return RouteDestination(
         next_node="HUMAN_REVIEW",

7. Log routing decision with full context
8. Return RouteDestination
```

### 2.6 Technical Approach

* **Module:** `assemblyzero/workflows/testing/exit_code_router.py`
* **Pattern:** Strategy pattern for exit code routing with stateful retry limit enforcement in verify functions
* **Key Decisions:** 
  - Exit codes are treated as authoritative over parsed pass/fail counts
  - Exit code history maintained for debugging workflow issues
  - Clear separation between "retry-able" errors (4,5) and "human required" errors (2,3)
  - Retry limit enforced in verify_phases (which has state access), not in stateless router
  - All routing decisions logged with reason for observability

### 2.7 Architecture Decisions

*Document key architectural decisions that affect the design.*

| Decision | Options Considered | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| Exit code vs. parsed output priority | Exit code only, Parsed output only, Hybrid | Exit code primary | Exit codes are pytest's contract; parsed output can miss edge cases |
| State storage for exit codes | Single value, History list, Both | Both | Single for current state, history for debugging failed workflows |
| Human review handling | Exception, Special return value, Flag in return | Flag in RouteDestination | Keeps control flow explicit without exception overhead |
| Re-scaffold retry limit | Unlimited, Fixed limit, Configurable | Configurable (default 3) | Prevents infinite loops while allowing customization |
| Retry limit enforcement location | In router function, In verify functions | In verify functions | Router is stateless by design; verify functions have state access |
| Logging strategy | Return-only, Log on decision, Both | Log on decision | Enables observability without requiring caller to log |

**Architectural Constraints:**
- Must integrate with existing TDD workflow state management
- Cannot change pytest execution - only interpret results
- Must be backwards compatible with existing verify_phases.py consumers
- Router function must remain stateless (state access via verify functions)

## 3. Requirements

*What must be true when this is done. These become acceptance criteria.*

1. Exit code 1 (tests failed) accepted as valid RED state, routes to N4
2. Exit code 4 (usage/syntax error) routes back to N2 (re-scaffold)
3. Exit code 5 (no tests collected) routes back to N2 (re-scaffold)
4. Exit codes 2,3 (interrupted/internal error) route to HUMAN_REVIEW
5. Exit code stored in TDD state for debugging
6. Exit code history maintained for workflow analysis
7. All routing decisions logged with reason
8. Backwards compatible with existing phase verification

## 4. Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| Parse pytest output for error type | Rich error information | Fragile to format changes, incomplete coverage | **Rejected** |
| Use exit codes only | Clean contract, official pytest API | Less detail in some cases | **Selected** |
| Hybrid approach (exit code + parsing) | Best of both worlds | Complexity, potential conflicts | Rejected |
| Add custom pytest plugin | Full control | Deployment complexity, maintenance burden | Rejected |

**Rationale:** Exit codes are pytest's official interface contract. They are stable, well-documented, and cover all the routing scenarios needed. Parsing stdout is fragile and may miss edge cases that exit codes capture.

## 5. Data & Fixtures

*Per [0108-lld-pre-implementation-review.md](0108-lld-pre-implementation-review.md) - complete this section BEFORE implementation.*

### 5.1 Data Sources

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Source | pytest execution return code |
| Format | Integer (0-5) |
| Size | Single integer per test run |
| Refresh | Per test execution |
| Copyright/License | N/A - pytest is MIT licensed |

### 5.2 Data Pipeline

```
pytest execution ──return code──► exit_code_router ──RouteDestination──► TDD workflow
                                        │
                                        ▼
                                   TDD state (exit_code, exit_code_history)
```

### 5.3 Test Fixtures

| Fixture | Source | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Mock pytest results with each exit code | Generated | Hardcoded exit codes 0-5 plus edge cases |
| TDD state fixture | Generated | Minimal state for testing routing |
| Phase context fixtures | Generated | RED, GREEN, REFACTOR phase contexts |
| Exit code history fixtures | Generated | Various history patterns for retry limit testing |

### 5.4 Deployment Pipeline

No external data - exit codes come from local pytest execution.

**If data source is external:** N/A - all data is from local pytest process.

## 7. Security & Safety Considerations

### 7.1 Security

| Concern | Mitigation | Status |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Exit code spoofing | Exit codes come from subprocess we control | Addressed |
| Invalid exit code injection | Validate exit code is in range 0-5, default to HUMAN_REVIEW | Addressed |

### 7.2 Safety

| Concern | Mitigation | Status |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Infinite re-scaffold loop (exit 4/5) | Retry limit enforced in verify_phases via exit_code_history check (default 3) | Addressed |
| Lost context on human review | Full state preserved including exit code history | Addressed |
| Silent failures | All routing decisions logged with reason | Addressed |
| Missing exit code in test result | Default to exit code 3 (INTERNAL_ERROR) with try/except | Addressed |

**Fail Mode:** Fail Closed - Unknown exit codes route to HUMAN_REVIEW

**Recovery Strategy:** Exit code history in state allows debugging; human review can manually override routing

## 8. Performance & Cost Considerations

### 8.1 Performance

| Metric | Budget | Approach |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Routing latency | < 1ms | Simple integer comparison, no I/O |
| Memory | < 1KB per decision | Small TypedDict, bounded history |
| State growth | Bounded | History capped at 100 entries |

**Bottlenecks:** None - this is a simple routing decision, not a performance-critical path

### 8.2 Cost Analysis

| Resource | Unit Cost | Estimated Usage | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Compute | N/A | Negligible | $0 |

**Cost Controls:**
- N/A - No external API calls or significant compute

**Worst-Case Scenario:** N/A - bounded memory, O(1) operations

## 9. Legal & Compliance

| Concern | Applies? | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|------------|
| PII/Personal Data | No | Exit codes contain no personal data |
| Third-Party Licenses | No | pytest is MIT licensed, compatible |
| Terms of Service | N/A | No external services |
| Data Retention | N/A | Ephemeral workflow state |
| Export Controls | No | Simple integer routing logic |

**Data Classification:** Internal

**Compliance Checklist:**
- [x] No PII stored without consent
- [x] All third-party licenses compatible with project license
- [x] External API usage compliant with provider ToS
- [x] Data retention policy documented

## 10. Verification & Testing

*Ref: [0005-testing-strategy-and-protocols.md](0005-testing-strategy-and-protocols.md)*

**Testing Philosophy:** 100% automated test coverage. All scenarios can be tested with mocked exit codes.

*Non-blocking recommendations from the reviewer.*

- **Type Safety**: In `assemblyzero/workflows/testing/exit_code_router.py`, consider using the `PytestExitCode(IntEnum)` defined in Section 2.3 for all internal comparisons rather than raw integers to improve readability.
- **Dependency Verification**: Ensure the upstream node providing `test_result` actually populates the `exit_code` field. While T160 covers the missing case (defaulting to HUMAN_REVIEW), verifying the producer ensures the workflow functions automatically.
