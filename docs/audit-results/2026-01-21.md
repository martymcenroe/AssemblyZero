   - README.md claims MIT license but no LICENSE file exists
   - pyproject.toml has no license field
   - Action: Create LICENSE file with MIT text

---

## High Priority Findings

1. **[HIGH] Test infrastructure broken**
   - `test_credentials.py` can't import `keyring` module
   - `test_sentinel.py` references migrated `sentinel` module
   - Action: Fix imports or remove orphaned test files

2. **[HIGH] File inventory severely outdated (0003-file-inventory.md)**
   - Lists 14 tools but only 12 exist (unleashed tools migrated)
   - Lists 19 audits but 28 exist in docs/audits/
   - Lists wrong number of standards (7 vs 9)
   - Skills section count wrong
   - Action: Full inventory refresh required

3. **[HIGH] Stale references after unleashed migration**
   - index.md references 0603-unleashed.md
   - README.md lists unleashed tools
   - Multiple docs reference sentinel module
   - Action: Cleanup post-migration references

4. **[HIGH] Missing implementation reports for closed issues**
   - Issue #7 (Phase 1 import) - no reports
   - Issue #20 (Shift+Tab fix) - no reports
   - Issue #23 (Gemini remediation) - no reports

## Medium Priority Findings

1. **[MEDIUM] Permission allowlist redundancy**

   - #1 (blog post) - no activity 10+ days
   - #2 (process improvements) - no activity 10+ days
   - #8 (Discord research) - no activity 9 days
   - Action: Close or update these issues

3. **[MEDIUM] Audit index drift**
   - docs/audits/ has files not in 0800-audit-index.md
   - Index references file names that don't match actual files
   - Action: Reconcile audit index with actual files
