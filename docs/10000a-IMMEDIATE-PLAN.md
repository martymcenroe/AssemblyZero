## Out of Scope for AssemblyZero Onboarding

These are child project concerns, not AssemblyZero concerns:
- Aletheia cross-reference updates (tracked in Aletheia)
- Talos LLD reviews (tracked in Talos)
- maintenance file inventory work (tracked in maintenance)

## How to Update

When priorities change:
1. Move completed items to "Recently Completed"
2. Add new items to "Active Work" or "Backlog"
3. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp
