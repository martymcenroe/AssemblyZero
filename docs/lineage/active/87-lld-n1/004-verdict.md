# Governance Verdict: BLOCK

The LLD provides a strong foundation for a TDD-enforced implementation agent using LangGraph. The separation of concerns (Scaffold vs. Code) and the "Red/Green" gate logic are architecturally sound. However, a **critical Safety issue** regarding Git state management and rollback logic exists. The design is ambiguous about whether it runs in the current working tree or a separate worktree, creating a risk of data loss for uncommitted user changes during an "Abort/Rollback" sequence.
