# Governance Verdict: BLOCK

The LLD provides a robust, deterministic approach to file naming that solves the collision and organization problems defined in the scope. The use of strict sanitization and deterministic hashing is architecturally sound. However, the design requires revision to address high-priority gaps in **Observability** (logging strategy) and **Quality** (wordlist safety) before implementation.
