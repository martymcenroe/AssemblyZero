# Governance Verdict: BLOCK

The LLD proposes a solid naming convention to improve issue tracking in multi-repo workflows. The reliance on standard libraries and stateless utilities is commendable. However, the design contains a critical logical flaw regarding the `generate_issue_word` strategy (potential exhaustion of the wordlist) and lacks explicit safety guards for file writing operations. These must be addressed before implementation.
