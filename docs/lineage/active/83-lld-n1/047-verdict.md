# Governance Verdict: BLOCK

The LLD proposes a structured naming convention for issue files. While the concept is sound and solves the multi-repo identification problem, there is a **critical missing logic component** regarding the `generate_issue_word` function and the limited size of the wordlist (80 words). Without explicit bounds and fallback logic defined in the pseudocode, this introduces a high risk of infinite loops or failure after a small number of issues.
