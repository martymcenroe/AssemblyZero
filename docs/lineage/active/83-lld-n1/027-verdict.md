# Governance Verdict: BLOCK

The LLD provides a robust solution for deterministic, collision-resistant file naming across multiple repositories. The use of a central `utils` module and deterministic hashing is architecturally sound. However, a critical Safety check regarding file write scoping is missing from the `save_audit_file` specification, and potential distributed numbering conflicts need to be addressed in the Risks section.
