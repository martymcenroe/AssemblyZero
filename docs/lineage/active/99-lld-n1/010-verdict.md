# Governance Verdict: APPROVED

The LLD is well-structured and directly addresses the requirements of Issue #99. It correctly identifies the need for a recursive data structure to handle arbitrary directory nesting, resolving the limitation of the previous draft. Security considerations regarding path traversal are explicitly handled. The test plan is robust.
