# Issue #19: chore: Review and rearrange audit classes/tiers

## Summary

Simple task to review the current audit categorization and rearrange among classes. The audit index (0800) has grown organically and needs a coherent re-organization pass.

## Current State

- 33 audits across 4 categories (Documentation Health, Core Development, AI Governance, Meta)
- Categories were created at different times with different philosophies
- Some audits may be miscategorized
- New tier concept: `--ultimate` for expensive/rare audits (see #18)

## Tasks

- [ ] Review all 33 audits for category fit
- [ ] Identify audits that should move categories
- [ ] Define --ultimate tier criteria and candidate audits
- [ ] Update 0800-audit-index.md with new organization
- [ ] Update frequency matrix if needed

## Context

This is a housekeeping task, not a redesign. Goal is coherence, not perfection.
