# Governance Verdict: BLOCK

The LLD provides a solid structural foundation for standardizing design artifacts. However, the logic flow in Section 2.5 proposes an autonomous "Draft -> Review -> Refine" loop without explicit iteration limits or user checkpoints. This presents a Tier 1 Cost risk (runaway token usage). This must be bounded before implementation.
