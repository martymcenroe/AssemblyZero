# Governance Verdict: BLOCK

The LLD proposes a robust, security-conscious refactor of the repository setup tool. The shift to a data-driven JSON schema is architecturally sound. The explicit inclusion of path traversal prevention (`_validate_safe_path`) is excellent and clears the primary security concern for file-system tools. However, the "template" mechanism is under-specified and requires definition before implementation to prevent ambiguity.
