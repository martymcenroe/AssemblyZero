# Governance Verdict: APPROVED

The LLD provides a robust, safety-conscious design for automated repository hygiene. The explicit separation of "Safe" vs. "Destructive" operations, combined with strict Git root enforcement and the "opt-in" model for deletion (`allow_destructive`), satisfies the primary safety requirements for an automated agent. The use of LangGraph for state management is appropriate.
