# Governance Verdict: BLOCK

The design leverages LangGraph effectively to orchestrate a maintenance pipeline, employing a clear separation of concerns (Sweeper, Fixer, Reporter). However, the LLD lacks critical safety boundaries regarding file system traversal (infinite loops/symlinks) and fails to explicitly define strict worktree containment for file scanning probes, which presents a Tier 1 Safety/Cost risk.
