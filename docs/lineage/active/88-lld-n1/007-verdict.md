# Governance Verdict: BLOCK

The LLD proposes a solid "Adapter" pattern for local RAG, ensuring the core system functions without heavy dependencies. However, it contains a **Blocking Safety issue** regarding file system traversal (symlinks) and a **High Priority Architecture error** where the implementation pseudocode violates the defined Data Structure contract. These must be fixed before implementation.
