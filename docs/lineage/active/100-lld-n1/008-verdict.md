# Governance Verdict: BLOCK

The LLD provides a robust mechanism for standardizing design artifacts with strong safeguards against data overwrites (`FileExistsError`) and runaway costs (`MAX_ITERATIONS`). However, a critical Safety issue regarding file path resolution (Worktree Scope) prevents immediate approval. The reliance on Current Working Directory (CWD) poses a risk of creating artifacts outside the intended project structure.
