# Governance Verdict: APPROVED

The LLD proposes a robust implementation workflow using LangGraph to enforce TDD cycles. The design explicitly addresses safety concerns by utilizing `git worktree` for isolation and includes strong validation for paths and secrets. The inclusion of a "Mock LLM" mode demonstrates good architectural foresight for testing and cost management. The design is mature and ready for implementation.
