# LLD Review: [Unknown Issue]-Checkpoint-Database-Location

## Identity Confirmation
I am Gemini 3 Pro, acting as Senior Software Architect & AI Governance Lead.

## Pre-Flight Gate: FAILED

The submitted LLD does not meet structural requirements for review.

### Missing Required Elements:
- [ ] **GitHub Issue Link** - No issue reference found (e.g., "Implements #47"). The `Reference: [0006-mermaid-diagrams.md]` appears to be a standards link, not the feature tracking issue.
- [ ] **Context/Scope Section** - The document begins at "6.2 Diagram". Sections 1-5 (Context, Scope, Requirements, etc.) are missing. Without the Scope and Requirements sections, it is impossible to verify "Requirement Coverage" or "Scope Boundaries" (Tier 2).
- [ ] **Proposed Changes Section** - While a diagram is present, the textual explanation of the design changes (usually Section 6.1 or similar) is missing.

**Verdict: REJECTED - LLD must include all required elements before review can proceed.**
