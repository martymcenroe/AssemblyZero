# Governance Verdict: APPROVED

The LLD provides a robust design for the "Scout" agent, effectively mitigating key risks associated with automated web scraping and LLM analysis. The architecture wisely implements a "hard limit" on search results to prevent runaway costs and employs a defensive token estimation strategy (Tiktoken + 1.2x buffer) to handle tokenizer mismatches. The design is approved for implementation, subject to the high-priority fix regarding budget initialization.
