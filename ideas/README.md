# Ideas

This folder contains pre-issue ideation - half-formed thoughts,
patent concepts, exploratory ideas not ready for the issue tracker.

**Encrypted:** This folder's contents are encrypted in git.
Only authorized users with the key can read these files.

## Naming Convention

- `YYYY-MM-slug.md` - Dated ideas
- `someday/` - "Maybe never" concepts
- Freeform names for evergreen ideas

## Security

**NEVER** use `echo "KEY" | base64 -d > file` - this leaks the key to shell history.
