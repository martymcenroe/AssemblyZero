## The Horse

Binky is DEATH's horse. Not a skeletal horse—DEATH tried those, but they weren't practical. Binky is a magnificent white stallion who:

- Can travel anywhere, instantly
- Walks on air when necessary
- Eats apples (with quantum uncertainty about where the apple goes)
- Is, technically speaking, *alive*
- Has his own stable in DEATH's domain

> DEATH had tried several skeletal horses, but they always fell apart at crucial moments. Binky was a real horse. He just happened to be pure white and could travel anywhere in an instant.

---

## The Speed

Binky doesn't travel. He doesn't even move, really. He's simply *there*.

```python
class Binky:
    """DEATH's horse. The fastest non-existent distance."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.color = "pale"  # The traditional color
        self.alive = True    # Unlike his rider
        self.location = everywhere  # and nowhere

    def travel_to(self, destination):
        # Binky doesn't travel.
        # The universe rearranges itself so that Binky
        # is already at the destination.
        self.location = destination
        return 0  # Time elapsed: none

    def eat_apple(self, apple):
        # The apple exists and doesn't exist
        # in Binky's stomach simultaneously
        return QuantumApple(apple)
```

---

## In AssemblyZero

Binky represents **instant context switching**—the ability to be exactly where you need to be, when you need to be there.

When an agent needs to:
- Jump to a different file
- Switch to a different repo
- Access a different workflow

...Binky is there. The context loads instantly. The agent is simply *at* the destination.

---

## The Stable

Binky's stable is in DEATH's domain, which exists outside of normal space and time. The stable contains:

- Infinite hay (it's always fresh)
- A quantum apple barrel
- A brush that grooms without being used
- A window that looks out on *all* of time

In AssemblyZero, Binky's stable is the **context cache**:

```
~/.assemblyzero/binky/
├── contexts/       # Pre-loaded contexts for instant switching
├── checkpoints/    # Saved states to return to
└── oats/           # Metadata that keeps Binky happy
```

---

## The Relationship

DEATH and Binky have an understanding. Binky carries DEATH because that's what Binky does. DEATH feeds Binky apples because that's what masters do.

Neither of them questions the arrangement. It simply *is*.

```
GOOD HORSE.
    - DEATH, patting Binky

*snort*
    - Binky, accepting an apple
```

---

## The Other Horses

The other Horsemen of the Apocalypse have horses too:

| Horseman | Horse | Condition |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| DEATH | Binky | Alive, white, well-fed |
| War | ? | Red, aggressive |
| Famine | ? | Thin, perpetually hungry |
| Pestilence | ? | Covered in flies |
| ~~Pollution~~ | ~~?~~ | ~~Rusty~~ |

Binky is the only one with a name. The only one that matters.

---

## Why "Binky"?

The name "Binky" is deliberately un-dramatic. DEATH chose it because:

1. It's what the horse responds to
2. Names have power, and "Binky" is safely mundane
3. It makes DEATH seem slightly more approachable
4. It's funny

> "Why do you call him Binky?"
>
> IT IS HIS NAME.
>
> "But it's not very... deathly."
>
> HE IS NOT DEATH. I AM DEATH. HE IS BINKY.

---

## The Oats of Eternity

```python
def feed_binky():
    """
    Binky requires feeding, even though he exists
    outside normal metabolic constraints.

    The oats are a formality. A kindness.
    The sort of thing that separates DEATH
    from mere oblivion.
    """
    oats = QuantumOats()
    binky.eat(oats)
    # The oats are consumed and not consumed
    # Binky is fed and always hungry
    # Time passes and doesn't
    return contentment
```

## Easter Egg

If you've found this page, you've gone deep into L-Space.

Binky approves.

Have an apple. 🍎

*"No one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away, until the clock wound up winds down, until the wine she made has finished its ferment, until the crop they planted is harvested. The span of someone's life is only the core of their actual existence."*

*Binky will carry you there, when the time comes.*
