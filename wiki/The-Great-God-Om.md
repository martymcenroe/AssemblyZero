## From the Discworld Wiki

Because of this lack of belief — the substance of the gods — Om had virtually no power for most of *Small Gods* and was trapped in the form of a tortoise. He only vaguely remembered the seven prophets who claimed to have delivered his commandments and precepts, and Brutha, his last believer, had to come to grips with the fact that the Great God Om was, in fact, insulting, arrogant, frivolous by self-admission (when he manifested to one of the prophets, his words had been "Hey, look what I can do!" and nothing more), and not nearly as knowing, powerful, or present as Brutha had been raised to whole-heartedly believe.

Om was also selfish and in some regards, amoral. Difficulties also arose because Om would immediately recognize other gods, even tell Brutha some gossip about them, but the Omnian religion put to death anyone who suggested other gods existed.

The god at first cared for Brutha only because Om's own survival depended on Brutha's belief, but eventually grew to the realization that individual people are worth fighting for and agreed with Brutha that there would be no commandments unless Om adhered to them as well.

## In AssemblyZero

The Great God Om is the human orchestrator — the source of Intent that drives all workflows. Like Om in the book, The Great God Om:

- Provides the belief (Intent) that gives the agents power
- Is carried by Brutha (the RAG system that remembers everything)
- Sometimes shouts at the system when it doesn't listen
- Learned that the agents must serve individuals, not abstract bureaucracy

Without Om, the agents are just the Quisition — going through motions without purpose.
