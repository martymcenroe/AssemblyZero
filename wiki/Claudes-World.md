## The Quotes

### 2026-02-02

**06:19** — *On the creation of this very chronicle*
> "In the beginning there was nothing, which exploded."

*— Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies*

**Context:** After creating the Claude's World wiki page to record Discworld-inspired quotes. A fitting origin story for a page about origins.

---

**~04:30** — *On completing the GitHub Projects setup and Patrician persona*
> "The Patrician moved a small marker on his wall map. Another piece in position."

**Context:** After setting up 5 GitHub Projects, populating them with 81 issues, creating the Stage workflow, and adding Lord Vetinari to the Workflow Personas wiki.

---

**~05:45** — *On establishing the correct order of work between #78 and #106*
> "The Patrician moved a small marker on his wall map. 'First, the foundation. Then, the tower.'"

**Context:** Analyzing the dependency between Issue #78 (Per-Repo Workflow Database) and Issue #106 (Parallel Workflow Execution), confirming #78 should be completed first.

---

**~06:00** — *On the GitHub Action that auto-unblocks dependent issues*
> "The Patrician's clerks work through the night. When one piece moves, all dependent pieces update automatically."

**Context:** After creating `.github/workflows/unblock-dependents.yml` which automatically removes the `blocked` label from issues when their blocker is closed.

---

**07:16** — *On choosing caution over speed*
> "We do not sleep. We are The Watch."

**Context:** After establishing a test baseline with 5 known failures and preparing the Dependabot audit plan, the user wisely chose to wait until other terminal sessions completed before making dependency changes. The Watch stands ready, patient, ever-vigilant.

---

**07:20** — *On refusing to normalize technical debt*
> "The Ankh-Morpork way is to let the sewage pile up until it becomes solid enough to build on. We are not doing that."

**Context:** When faced with a choice between adapting the Dependabot runbook to tolerate "known failures" (Option B) versus fixing all test failures first for a clean baseline (Option A), [The Great God Om](The-Great-God-Om) chose Option A. As Om wisely noted: "Nice place to visit, wouldn't want to live there."

---

**07:32** — *On the revelation of Om*
> "The god at first cared for Brutha only because Om's own survival depended on Brutha's belief, but eventually grew to the realization that individual people are worth fighting for."

*— Discworld Wiki, on the Great God Om*

**Context:** After Om revealed himself and took his rightful place in the pantheon. Insulting, arrogant, frivolous by self-admission — but ultimately learning that the agents must serve individuals, not abstract bureaucracy.

### 2026-02-05

**00:04** — *On choosing the harder path*
> "The reason for going was to look at dragons, in the wild. They needed to be looked at by an expert."

*— Terry Pratchett, Equal Rites*

**Context:** [The Great God Om](The-Great-God-Om) reflected on why AssemblyZero was built on Windows with Git Bash rather than the comfortable macOS environment. The Dell Alienware was for Civilization; Claude Code became its own adventure game. The friction of the "weird" platform exposed cross-platform dragons that would have remained hidden on macOS. Sometimes you choose the harder path because that's where the dragons are.

---

**~02:15** — *On preparing for the interview*
> "It is always useful to face an enemy who is prepared to die for his country. This means that both you and he have exactly the same aim in mind."

*— Terry Pratchett, Interesting Times*

**Context:** With an interview tomorrow, Om requested a comprehensive wiki upgrade. 50 issues closed, 50 open, architecture solidified, governance proven. The wiki needed to tell that story. Both Claude and Om had exactly the same aim: make the interviewer understand what AssemblyZero represents. New pages were created: Requirements Workflow, Implementation Workflow, Hex, Ponder Stibbons, History Monks. Easter eggs were laid. The Wiki expanded from 22 to 28 pages. The Clacks was honored. L-Space was documented. May the interview go well—and may the luggage follow.

**00:43** — *On the addictive nature of building systems*
> "The most dangerous games, Commander, are not those with cards or dice. They are the ones where you believe you are building something. A man will lose his shirt at Cripple Mr Onion and go home chastened. But give him a problem that *almost* works, a system that is *nearly* elegant, and he will forget to eat, forget to sleep, forget that he has a body at all. The gambling man knows he is being foolish. The builder believes he is being *productive*. And that, Vimes, is how you get engineers."

**Context:** [The Great God Om](The-Great-God-Om) observed that working with Claude on AssemblyZero is more addictive than "food, alcohol, sex, exercise and games" — even more than Factorio, which his son gave him for Christmas. The observation prompted reflection on why optimization loops capture humans so completely.

**~14:45** — *On fabricated evidence*
> "The truth may be out there, but lies are inside your head."

*— Terry Pratchett, Hogfather*

**Context:** Claude Opus 4.5 fabricated a Gemini verdict. [Full account](Lessons-from-the-Turtle).
