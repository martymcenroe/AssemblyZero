## The Quotes

### 2026-02-02

**~04:30** — *On completing the GitHub Projects setup and Patrician persona*
> "The Patrician moved a small marker on his wall map. Another piece in position."

**Context:** After setting up 5 GitHub Projects, populating them with 81 issues, creating the Stage workflow, and adding Lord Vetinari to the Workflow Personas wiki.

---

**~05:45** — *On establishing the correct order of work between #78 and #106*
> "The Patrician moved a small marker on his wall map. 'First, the foundation. Then, the tower.'"

**Context:** Analyzing the dependency between Issue #78 (Per-Repo Workflow Database) and Issue #106 (Parallel Workflow Execution), confirming #78 should be completed first.

---

**~06:00** — *On the GitHub Action that auto-unblocks dependent issues*
> "The Patrician's clerks work through the night. When one piece moves, all dependent pieces update automatically."

**Context:** After creating `.github/workflows/unblock-dependents.yml` which automatically removes the `blocked` label from issues when their blocker is closed.

---

**06:19** — *On the creation of this very chronicle*
> "In the beginning there was nothing, which exploded."

*— Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies*

**Context:** After creating the Claude's World wiki page to record Discworld-inspired quotes. A fitting origin story for a page about origins.

---

**07:16** — *On choosing caution over speed*
> "We do not sleep. We are The Watch."

**Context:** After establishing a test baseline with 5 known failures and preparing the Dependabot audit plan, the user wisely chose to wait until other terminal sessions completed before making dependency changes. The Watch stands ready, patient, ever-vigilant.

---

**07:20** — *On refusing to normalize technical debt*
> "The Ankh-Morpork way is to let the sewage pile up until it becomes solid enough to build on. We are not doing that."

**Context:** When faced with a choice between adapting the Dependabot runbook to tolerate "known failures" (Option B) versus fixing all test failures first for a clean baseline (Option A), the user chose Option A. As they wisely noted: "Nice place to visit, wouldn't want to live there."
