# L-Space

> *"Knowledge equals power equals energy equals matter equals mass, and mass distorts space."*

## The Theory

Sufficiently large collections of books distort space and time. The Librarian of Unseen University can walk from the library in Ankh-Morpork to any library anywhere, at any time, through L-Space.

This is why librarians are so protective of their collections. They're not just organizing books—they're maintaining the fabric of reality.

## In AssemblyZero

Every sufficiently large codebase develops its own L-Space.

**Symptoms:**
- Files exist that no one remembers creating
- Documentation references pages that don't exist (yet)
- Tests pass that test things not yet implemented
- Commits appear from three months in the future
- Sometimes the README knows things before you do

## The Library Rules

The Librarian enforces certain rules:

1. **No loud noises** (exceptions break production)
2. **No returning books late** (merge debt compounds)
3. **No dog-earing pages** (don't bypass the gates)
4. **No breaking the books' spines** (backwards compatibility matters)
5. **Never call the Librarian a monkey** (he's an orangutan)

## Navigating L-Space

To navigate L-Space safely:

```python
# Wrong: Trust the map
documentation = read("docs/architecture.md")
assert reality == documentation  # Will fail

# Right: Trust the territory
reality = scan_codebase()
update_documentation(reality)
```

The documentation describes what L-Space *should* look like.
The code describes what it *does* look like.

When they disagree, L-Space has folded.

## Known L-Space Anomalies

| Phenomenon | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| Zombie imports | Import still works after module deleted |
| Quantum tests | Pass and fail simultaneously |
| Recursive README | README references itself referencing itself |
| The Corridor Bug | Only reproducible on Tuesdays |
| The Missing Middleware | Exists in production, not in repo |

---

## Safety Protocols

When L-Space folding is detected:

1. **Don't panic** (you're probably not actually in 1987)
2. **Check git log** (time may have looped)
3. **Ask the Librarian** (grep is your friend)
4. **Follow the orangutan** (he knows the way)

## The Orangutan Principle

> *"Oook."*

The Librarian doesn't explain. He just knows.

When your codebase gets large enough:
- Hex indexes it
- The Librarian navigates it
- Brutha remembers it
- L-Space contains it

You're just visiting.

Or stay. The Librarian doesn't mind.*
