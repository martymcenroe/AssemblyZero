## The World Turtle

The Discworld rests on the backs of four elephants—Berilia, Tubul, Great T'Phon, and Jerakeen—who in turn stand on the shell of Great A'Tuin, the giant star turtle who swims through space.

No one knows where A'Tuin is going. No one knows why. But the turtle moves.

## In AssemblyZero

Every system needs a foundation. Something that just... moves. Something you don't question, you just trust.

For AssemblyZero, the turtle is **the orchestrator**. The human who provides Intent. The Great God Om riding on the shell of Great A'Tuin, carried through the cosmos by a turtle that simply *moves*.

## The Question

> *"The philosophers have often debated whether the Big Bang was caused by the collision of two branes, the collapse of a false vacuum, or the hatching of a cosmic turtle. The truth, as is often the case, involves turtles."*

In software, we often ask: "Where does the system come from? What started it?"

The answer: a human decided to build something. The turtle moved. The rest is implementation details.

## Turtles All The Way Down

A well-known scientist once gave a public lecture on astronomy. At the end, a little old lady said: "What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise."

The scientist asked: "What is the tortoise standing on?"

"You're very clever, young man," said the old lady. "But it's turtles all the way down!"

---

In AssemblyZero:
- The agents stand on the workflows
- The workflows stand on the governance
- The governance stands on the orchestrator
- The orchestrator stands on Intent

And Intent? That's the turtle at the bottom. It doesn't stand on anything. It just *moves*.

---

## The Movement

```python
while True:
    turtle.move()
    # That's it. That's the whole system.
```

*"The turtle moves."*
