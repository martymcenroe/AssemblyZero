## The Hogfather

On the Disc, the Hogfather is the jolly fat man who delivers presents on Hogswatch Night (the winter solstice). He rides a sleigh pulled by four massive hogs—Gouger, Rooter, Tusker, and Snouter—and climbs down chimneys to leave gifts.

When the Hogfather was threatened with un-existence, DEATH had to take over the role. He did his best.

> HO. HO. HO.
> — DEATH, doing his best

## In AssemblyZero

Every year, we celebrate Hogswatch. It's the night when the code freezes, the deploys stop, and we remember why we built this thing in the first place.

### The Hogswatch Protocol

On Hogswatch Night (December 21):
1. No new issues created
2. No deploys to production
3. All agents get the night off
4. The orchestrator has a drink

This isn't superstition—it's *tradition*. And tradition matters.

## The Presents

The Hogfather doesn't just bring toys. He brings *belief*. Children believe, and so the Hogfather exists.

In AssemblyZero, belief looks like:
- Trust that the governance works
- Faith that the agents will do their jobs
- Confidence that the system improves itself

Without belief, the whole thing is just code. With belief, it's a system that *matters*.

## The Tooth Fairy

> *"All right, I'm not stupid. You're saying humans need fantasies to make life bearable."*
>
> REALLY? AS IF IT WAS SOME KIND OF PINK PILL? NO. HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN. TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE FALLING ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE.
>
> — DEATH, Hogfather

The Tooth Fairy, like the Hogfather, exists because humans need small beliefs to practice believing in big ones.

In software:
- We believe tests prove correctness (they don't, really)
- We believe code reviews catch bugs (they catch some)
- We believe governance prevents disasters (it helps)

These small beliefs let us believe in bigger things:
- That software can be built well
- That AI can be helpful
- That complex systems can be understood

## The Audit

On Hogswatch Night, DEATH conducts an audit:

```
HAVE YOU BEEN GOOD?

Well... mostly.

THAT WILL HAVE TO DO.
```

---

## Anti-Hogswatch

Some years, the code doesn't freeze. The deploys continue. The agents work through the night.

This is called **Anti-Hogswatch**, and it's reserved for:
- Critical production incidents
- Security vulnerabilities
- That one bug that's been bothering you for weeks

On Anti-Hogswatch, we work so that normal Hogswatches can happen in the future.

## The Belief Engine

```python
class Hogfather:
    def __init__(self):
        self.belief = 1.0

    def deliver_presents(self, children):
        for child in children:
            if child.believes:
                child.receive(Present())
                self.belief += 0.01  # belief compounds
            else:
                self.belief -= 0.01

        if self.belief <= 0:
            raise UnExistenceError("The Hogfather fades...")
```

The Hogfather exists because children believe. AssemblyZero works because users believe.

Don't stop believing.
